# RadarPlot
A tool to generate and solve radar plotting problems for teaching Radar and Automatic Plotting Aids

Initially concieved as a tool to quickly generate answers to typical radar plotting and ARPA exercises.

Used as an exercise to learn Python(2.7), play with classes, and explore Tkinter.

The code is poorly documented, contains little error handling and is more than somewhat brutal.

It is an attempt (as a complete noob) to be as pythonic as possible.

Complex arithmetic has been used to handle the vector arithmetic.  This undoubtedly could do with some improvement.

There are a couple of as-yet unimplemented options in the Trial Manouver window (Saving TM's to file & alternative TM's).

A needed improvement is to toggle display of O/W/A individually.
